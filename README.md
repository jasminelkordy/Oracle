# Oracle

As humans, we tend to seek for greater meaning in life and it's tempting to
believe in higher powers and things like destiny to give meaning to our existence. 
Itâ€™s not uncommon to seek for guidance from horoscopes as if some higher order controls our lives. 

You can ask the Oracle questions and it tells you what to do as if it had access to some hidden knowledge. 
But behind the curtain is just an array of different responses, randomly triggered on the press of a button. 
Using the Math.random function to trigger responses emphasises the randomness factor and denotes
how we tend to attribute greater meaning to random events. The responses are arbitrary and most of them quite vague, 
and hopefully, make you laugh and remember how silly it is to ask a computer to predict your future. 
Or inspire you to take action. Ultimately, there are no right or wrong choices, 
and you have the power to take control of your own future. You can get any kind of recommendations 
regarding what you should do, but still have to decide yourself what you actually want to do.
