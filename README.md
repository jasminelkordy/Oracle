# Oracle

As humans, we are constantly seeking for a greater meaning in life and are easily drawn to
believing in higher powers and things like destiny to give meaning to our existence. Itâ€™s not
uncommon to seek for guidance from horoscopes and to believe that some higher order
controls our lives. 

The process of building the oracle was intriguing. 
Users can type in a question and the oracle tells what to do as if it had access to some hidden knowledge. 
But behind the curtain is just an array of different responses that are randomly triggered on the press of a button. 
Using the Math.random function to trigger responses emphasises the randomness factor and denotes
how we tend to attribute greater meaning to random events. The responses
the oracle gives are arbitrary and most of them quite vague, and hopefully, make the user laugh
and realise how silly it is to ask a computer to predict your future. Or inspire to take action. 
At the end of the day, you can get any kind of recommendations regarding what you should do, but
still have to decide for yourself what you actually want to do. Ultimately, there are no right or wrong choices, 
and you have the power to take control of your own future.
